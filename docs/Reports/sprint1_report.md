## What's New (User Facing)
* Gathered project requirements through multiple stakeholder meetings
* Set up GitHub repository for version control and collaboration
* Built initial frontend framework
* Incorporated mentor feedback (10/02/25) to refine requirements and user stories
* Created Neon database project for backend data storage

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint was dedicated to project foundation and planning. We held several meetings with stakeholders to understand their needs, but quickly discovered significant gaps between the original proposal and their actual requirements. This required us to go back multiple times to clarify expectations and align on scope. On October 2nd, we met with our mentor who provided feedback that prompted us to restructure how we approached our requirements and user stories. While this added extra work, it helped us avoid potential issues down the road. In parallel, we created our GitHub repository, got the frontend environment up and running, and set up a Neon database project for our backend. The main takeaway from this sprint is that early-stage communication, both with clients and mentors, takes more time than we expected, but it's essential for setting the right direction.

## Unfinished Work
We're still finalizing the requirements and user stories based on what our mentor suggested on October 2nd. Once those are locked in, we'll create proper GitHub issues for Sprint 2. We want to make sure we have the right foundation before committing to specific development tasks.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here's what we got done (we created the GitHub issues for tracking after the fact):

Issue #6: Initialize Neon db
Issue #5: Initialize git repo and code scaffolding
Issue #4: Create UML use case diagram
Issue #3: Choose tech stack
Issue #2: Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
Issue #1: User Login

We also held stakeholder meetings, met with our mentor, and started revising our requirements based on the feedback we received.
 
## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
* N/A - Moving forward we'll be tracking everything through GitHub issues from the start.

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files developed during this sprint:

* Frontend initialization and Repository structure

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* We established good communication with stakeholders despite initial confusion
* Repository setup and frontend initialization went smoothly
* Everyone was open to the feedback and willing to revise our approach
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Better upfront validation of proposals against actual client needs
* More systematic documentation of requirements as we gather them

  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Complete the revised requirements and user stories
* Set up GitHub issues with acceptance criteria and story points before starting work
* Implement basic student login functionality with authentication
* Create dashboard placeholder that students see after logging in
* Connect frontend to Neon database for user management
* Create a requirement validation checklist to catch discrepancies earlier
