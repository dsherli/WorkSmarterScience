# Work Smarter Science

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

A standalone learning platform with a built-in Virtual Teaching Assistant that ingests course materials to deliver instant, context-aware answers for students, facilitate group discussions, and give privacy-respecting analytics for instructors, purpose-built for classrooms.

### Additional information about the project

The Work Smarter Science project aims to reimagine digital learning by creating an all-in-one educational ecosystem as a self-contained platform for both students and instructors. VTA provides intelligent, real-time academic assistance using assesment materials, offering students instant feedback and clarification while maintaining academic integrity.

Instructors can manage assements, view analytics, and monitor student progress through a streamlined interface. The system emphasizes inclusivity, engagement, and scalability, supporting large classrooms without sacrificing individualized learning experiences.

- **pip** - Python package installer (usually comes with Python) 

### Add-ons

This project includes the following key packages and their purposes:

**Backend (Django):**
- **Django 5.2.7** - Core web framework for the API backend
- **Django REST Framework 3.16.1** - Provides RESTful API functionality and serialization
- **django-cors-headers 4.9.0** - Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication
- **asgiref 3.10.0** - ASGI reference implementation for async support
- **sqlparse 0.5.3** - SQL parsing utilities for Django

**Frontend (React):**
- **React 19.1.1** - Core UI library for building the user interface
- **TypeScript 5.9.3** - Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience
- **Vite 7.1.7** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.14** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **ESLint 9.36.0** - Code linting and formatting
- **Autoprefixer 10.4.21** - Automatic vendor prefixing for CSS

### Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the Virtual Teaching Assistant project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dsherli/WorkSmarterScience.git
   cd WorkSmarterScience
   ```

2. **Set up the Django backend:**
   ```bash
   cd code/backend

   # Create virtual environment if it doesn't exist
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Set up the React frontend (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd code/frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Build Tailwind CSS (optional, for production):**
   ```bash
   cd code/frontend
   npm run css:build
   ```

**Development Notes:**
- The backend uses SQLite database by default (no additional setup required)
- CORS is configured to allow all origins in development (will need to be tightened for production)
- Both servers need to run simultaneously for full functionality
- Frontend hot-reloads automatically when you make changes 


## Functionality

**Current Status: Project Foundation Complete**

The project currently provides a solid foundation for the Virtual Teaching Assistant with the following implemented features:

### Available Now
- **Backend API Health Check**: `GET /api/health/` returns server status
- **Django Admin Interface**: Available at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` for database management
- **React Development Environment**: Hot-reloading frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **CORS Configuration**: Backend configured to accept requests from frontend development server


## Known Problems

- **Missing Key Features**: We have not successfully implemented many of the key features of the app including student accounts and view, teacher accounts and dashboard, and AI chatbot functionality.
